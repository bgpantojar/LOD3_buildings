# LOD3_buildings
This repository contains the codes for computing geometrical digital twins as LOD3 models for buildings using a structure from motion and semantic segmentation. The methodoly hereby implementes was presented in the paper "Generating LOD3 building models from structure-from-motion and semantic segmentation" by Pantoja-Rosero et., al.
